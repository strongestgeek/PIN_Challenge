# Service Tags and PINs Challenge

Welcome to the Service Tags and PINs Challenge! Below is a list of service tags paired with their corresponding PINs. Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to figure out the pattern or method used to derive the PIN from each service tag for the tags that are missing PINs.

## Objective

We have a list of 50 service tags, but only 25 of them have their corresponding PINs. Your challenge is to:

Is generating PINs based on the device's serial number secure? It might be easy for an It team to know the pin if they also have the algorithm.
But how secure is it? How easy is it to reverse engineer? 

1. **Discover the Pattern**: Find the logic or algorithm that relates each service tag to its PIN.
2. **Fill in the Missing PINs**: Use the discovered pattern to generate the PINs for the remaining 25 service tags.

## Data

The data is provided in a CSV File. Please respect the privacy and security of this information by not misusing it.

## How to Participate

1. **Fork this Repository**: Create your own copy of this repository to work on.
2. **Analyse the Data**: Look for patterns, commonalities, or any logical connection between the service tags and their PINs.
3. **Submit Your Solution**: Once you think you've cracked the code, submit your solution by creating a pull request or by creating an issue with your findings. Please explain your method and provide the generated PINs for the missing entries.

## Rules

- **No Misuse**: This data is for educational and challenge purposes only. Do not attempt to use this information for any malicious activities.
- **Collaborative Spirit**: Feel free to discuss methods and approaches in the comments, but remember to keep the solution discovery process fair for all participants.
- **Respect**: Respect other participants and their contributions.
- **No real data**: All serial numbers and PINs are auto-generated and should not be real.

## Good Luck!

We look forward to seeing your creative solutions and logical deductions! Remember, the goal is not just to find the answer but to understand the underlying mechanism. Happy cracking!

## Notes

This showcases how something appearing complex and secure, can be rendered useless and dangerous if broken.
Once someone works out how these PINs are generated, there is nothing stopping the "attacker" from generating all PINs, for all possible serial numbers past, present or future.

A bit like Enigma, total perfection until it wasn't.
